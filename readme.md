Introduction
============

This is an anonymised version of a .NET stack demo application I did in 2014 for
a job interview.

At the time, I had never used ASP.NET MVC and hadn't touched Entity Framework
in over 4 years.

The criteria was to build an ASP.NET MVC application from scratch with no tool assistance.

I built this thing in a week using Vim, GNU Make, a command line C#
compiler, the Cassini development web server, and (I think) SQL Server Express.

After all this trouble, the company made me a shitty job offer which I declined.
